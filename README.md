# Retail Sales Analysis 

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing retail sales data using SQL to derive meaningful business insights. The dataset includes transaction-level information such as customer demographics, product categories, sales values, and timestamps.

The objective of this project is to perform data validation, exploration, and analytical querying to understand sales trends, customer behavior, and overall business performance.

## Project Workflow

### Table Creation
- Created a structured table to store retail sales data using appropriate data types.

### Data Quality Checks
- Performed null value checks on all critical columns to ensure data integrity.

### Data Exploration
- Calculated the total number of sales records.
- Identified the total number of unique customers.
- Extracted distinct product categories.

### Analytical Queries
- Executed business-driven analytical queries to uncover meaningful insights.

## Key Analytical Queries

### Sales on a Specific Date
- Retrieved all transactions that occurred on `2022-11-05`.

### Category and Quantity Analysis
- Extracted transactions for the **Clothing** category with quantity sold above a defined threshold during **November 2022**.

### Category-wise Total Sales
- Calculated total sales revenue generated by each product category.

### Customer Demographics Analysis
- Computed the average age of customers purchasing products from the **Beauty** category.

### High-Value Transactions
- Identified transactions where total sales exceeded a high-value threshold.

### Gender-wise Transaction Distribution
- Analyzed the number of transactions made by each gender across product categories.

### Monthly Sales Trend Analysis
- Calculated monthly sales figures.
- Identified the best-performing month in each year using window functions.

### Top Customers Analysis
- Identified the top five customers based on total sales contribution.

### Unique Customers per Category
- Calculated the number of unique customers who purchased products from each category.

### Shift-wise Order Analysis
- Classified sales into time-based shifts:
  - **Morning:** Before 12 PM
  - **Afternoon:** 12 PM to 5 PM
  - **Evening:** After 5 PM
- Calculated the total number of orders placed in each shift.

## SQL Concepts Demonstrated
- `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` clauses
- `COUNT` and `COUNT(DISTINCT)`
- `SUM` and `AVG`
- `CASE WHEN` conditional logic
- Date and time functions
- Window functions (`RANK`)
- Subqueries
- Filtering using date ranges

---

## Key Insights
- Sales performance varies across product categories and time periods.
- Certain months consistently outperform others within each year.
- A small group of customers contributes a significant share of total sales.
- Order volume differs across time-based shifts.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of SQL for end-to-end retail sales analysis, including data validation, exploration, and advanced analytical querying. It highlights the ability to transform raw transactional data into meaningful business insights, making it suitable for Data Analyst and Business Analyst roles.
